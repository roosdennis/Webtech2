    <h2>Schakel tussen Dag- en Nachtmodus</h2>
    <p>George: you ever think of running for class president? Marty, why are you so nervous? Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Uh, I think so. I'm writing this down, this is good stuff.</p>
    <p>I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. What, what, ma? Unroll their fire. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. In that case, I'll tell you strait out.</p>
    <p>Right about here. Excuse me. Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? You broke it. Wow, look at him go. What's with the life preserver?</p>
    <p>I'm gonna ram him. Precisely. The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. No, Doc.</p>
    <p>Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man. Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Why not? Uh, yeah. That's a big bruise you have there.</p>
    <p>Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- Just finishing up the second coat now. Say that again. Yeah, I think maybe you do.</p>
    <p> What? Yeah, he's right here. I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit.</p>
